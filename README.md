How to run the code
Quickstart

Welcome to the Ren'Py quickstart manual. The purpose of this manual is to demonstrate how you can make a Ren'Py game from scratch in a few easy steps. We'll do this by showing how to make a simple game, The Question.
The Ren'Py Launcher

Before you begin making a game, you should first take some time to learn how the Ren'Py launcher works. The launcher lets you create, manage, edit, and run Ren'Py projects.

Getting Started. To get started you'll want to download Ren'Py.

Once you've downloaded Ren'Py, you'll want to extract and run it.

    On Windows, double click on the executable file you download. It will extract Ren'Py into a folder named renpy-<version>. You can change into that folder and run renpy.exe. (The renpy.exe file may be presented as renpy if extensions are hidden.)
    On Mac OS X, double-click on the downloaded drive image to mount it as a drive. When the drive opens, copy the folder named renpy-<version> somewhere else. (Where does not matter, but it has to be moved out of the read-only drive image. Do not move the renpy app out of the folder it's in â€“ it won't work elsewhere.) Then change into it, and run the renpy application.
    On Linux, unpack the tarball, change into the renpy-<version> directory, and then run renpy.sh.

After running this, the Ren'Py launcher should run.

The Ren'Py launcher has been translated to multiple languages. To change the language, choose "preferences" at the bottom right, and then select the language.

Choosing and Launching a Project. You should first see what the completed The Question game looks like. To do this, start the Ren'Py launcher, and choose "The Question" from the first screen. Choose "Launch Project" to start The Question.

You can get back to the Ren'Py demo by doing the same thing, but choosing "Tutorial" instead of "The Question".
